# Machine Learning Project

This repository contains a machine learning project designed to solve a specific problem using advanced techniques. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and scales numerical features.
- **Feature Engineering**: Implements techniques to enhance model performance through data transformation.
- **Model Training**: Trains multiple machine learning models and optimizes their performance using hyperparameter tuning.
- **Evaluation**: Compares models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **Deployment**: Provides a deployment pipeline to integrate the trained model into real-world applications.

## Requirements
To run this project, the following dependencies are required:
- Python 3.8+
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Flask or Streamlit (for deployment)

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ghanagokul/mlproject.git
   cd mlproject
   ```

2. **Run the Training Script**:
   Execute the script to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

3. **Deploy the Model**:
   Use the provided deployment script (e.g., Flask or Streamlit) to deploy the trained model:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Input Data for Prediction**:
   Provide input features through the deployed interface or script, and the model will generate predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes:
- **Features**: Includes various numerical and categorical data points relevant to the problem.
- **Target Variable**: The outcome or label that the model predicts.

Details on the dataset and preprocessing are provided in the project scripts.

## Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning**: Removes inconsistencies and prepares the dataset.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes data trends and relationships.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creates and selects important features.
4. **Model Training**: Trains and compares models like Random Forest, SVM, and Gradient Boosting.
5. **Model Deployment**: Integrates the best-performing model into a deployable application.

## Results
- **Performance Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix.
- **Visualization**: Plots such as feature importance, ROC curve, and more for model evaluation.

## Future Enhancements
- Experiment with deep learning models for complex datasets.
- Implement automated machine learning (AutoML) for hyperparameter tuning.
- Deploy on cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or GCP for scalability.
